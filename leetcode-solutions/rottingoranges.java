//In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:
// the value 0 representing an empty cell;
// the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
// the value 2 representing a rotten orange.

// Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
// Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.



need to use BFS to slowly expand the layers of the graph until 
every organge is rotten


//TC: O(N) where n is number of grids in cell
//SC: O(N) for queue 

//INSIGHTS
//1. we know that if there are no fresh organes to begin with, 
//we can return 0, start off by couting number of 
//fresh organges and put positions of rottens into queue. 
//2. run bfs from initially rotten oranges
//3. mark organges as rotten
//4. put new rotten organe in queue
//5. decrease amount of fresh organges.
