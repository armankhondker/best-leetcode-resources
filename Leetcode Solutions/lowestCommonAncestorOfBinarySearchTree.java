Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.


INTUITION, similar to regular find lowest common ancestor of binary tree, but we need to use property,
of BST!!

We can iteratively recurse, if p and q are greater than root then go right, if p and q are
less than root then go left, if NOT then we reach a split point where we found LCA!!


//TC: O(N) to go through all the nodes in worst case
//SC: O(1) 

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {

        // Value of p
        int pVal = p.val;

        // Value of q;
        int qVal = q.val;

        // Start from the root node of the tree
        TreeNode node = root;

        // Traverse the tree
        while (node != null) {

            // Value of ancestor/parent node.
            int parentVal = node.val;

            if (pVal > parentVal && qVal > parentVal) {
                // If both p and q are greater than parent
                node = node.right;
            } else if (pVal < parentVal && qVal < parentVal) {
                // If both p and q are lesser than parent
                node = node.left;
            } else {
                // We have found the split point, i.e. the LCA node.
                return node;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
